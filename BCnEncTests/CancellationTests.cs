	// HINT: Decoding in general is too fast to be cancelled.
	// HINT: For parallel decoding even with TimeSpan.FromTicks(1) the test never successfully threw an exception when executed in bulk with other tests.
	// HINT: For non parallel decoding the test was partially successful, due to fluctuations in how much time the decoding needed and when the cancellation was introduced.
